# Admin Page & DynamicStrapiForm Architecture

## Overview
This document explains the architecture and data flow of the admin page and dynamic form system in this project. It focuses on how the admin page renders forms for Strapi collections using `DynamicStrapiForm`, and how the form system is powered by the `useFormFactory` hook and field-to-component mappings.

---

## 1. Admin Page Construction

- **File:** `src/app/admin/page.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Provides a dynamic admin UI for managing Strapi collections and their records.

### Key Steps:
1. **Schema Loading:**
   - Uses `useStrapiSchemas` context to load all available Strapi schemas.
2. **Collection Selection:**
   - Renders a `<select>` for the user to choose a collection.
3. **Data Fetching:**
   - Fetches records for the selected collection using the Strapi service.
4. **Table Display:**
   - Dynamically renders a table of records, with headers and cells based on the collection schema.
5. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Supports Create, Update, and Delete via UI buttons.
   - For Create/Update, opens a form powered by `DynamicStrapiForm`.
6. **Normalization:**
   - Uses `normalizeRelationsForUpdate` to convert relation/media fields to scalar DB ids before sending to Strapi (see memory: media fields must be sent as ids).

## 2. DynamicStrapiForm

- **File:** `src/components/dynamic-form/DynamicStrapiForm.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Renders a dynamic form for any Strapi collection, based on its schema and a field config.

### Key Steps:
1. **Schema & Field Config:**
   - Receives the collection name, document (for edit), and loads the schema from context.
   - Uses a utility (`strapiToFormConfig`) to convert the Strapi schema to a list of field configs.
2. **Form Factory:**
   - Calls `useFormFactory` with:
     - Zod schema for validation
     - Initial values (from document or defaults)
     - Field config (labels, types, component mapping, etc.)
     - Relation options map (for select fields)
3. **Form Rendering:**
   - Wraps the form in a React Hook Form provider.
   - Renders fields using `formFactory.renderFields()`.
   - Handles submit/cancel, and calls parent callbacks for success/error.

## 3. useFormFactory Hook

- **File:** `src/hooks/useFormFactory.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Centralizes form logic: validation, field rendering, and field-to-component mapping.

### Features:
- Initializes React Hook Form with Zod validation and default values.
- Provides a `renderFields` function that:
  - Iterates over the field config.
  - Maps each field to the correct UI component (input, select, date, etc.).
  - Handles special logic for select/enum fields to ensure value is always a scalar for single-select (avoids React warning about defaultValue).
  - Passes error messages and field props as needed.
- Returns the form instance, field config, and renderFields function.

---

## 4. Field Config & Component Mapping

- **FieldConfig:**
  - Each field in a form is described by a FieldConfig object (name, label, type, required, component, etc.).
  - The mapping from Strapi schema to FieldConfig is handled by `strapiToFormConfig`.
- **Component Mapping:**
  - Each field type is mapped to a React component (input, select, date picker, etc.).
  - For relations/enums, options are provided and selects are rendered.
  - For media, file inputs are rendered and normalized before submission.

---

## 5. Data Normalization for Strapi

- Before sending data to Strapi (create/update), relation and media fields are normalized:
  - **Single relation/media:** Sent as a DB id (number) or null.
  - **Multiple relation/media:** Sent as an array of DB ids.
  - This avoids errors and matches Strapiâ€™s API requirements (see memory: media fields as ids).

---

## 6. Error Handling & Validation

- Uses Zod schemas for validation.
- Displays error messages per field in the form.
- Handles errors from Strapi API and displays them in the UI.
