# Task: Analyze Login Flow Implementation

**Status:** Planned

## Objective
Investigate and plan the implementation of a secure and user-friendly login flow for the application. The goal is to establish authentication best practices, select appropriate technologies, and ensure a seamless user experience.

## Expected Outcome
- A clear plan for adding a login/authentication flow to the app, with recommended approaches and next steps for implementation.

## Areas to Investigate
- Authentication strategy (e.g., JWT, OAuth, session-based, social login, etc.)
- Integration with existing backend (e.g., Strapi, custom API)
- UI/UX for login, logout, and error handling
- Security considerations (password storage, brute-force protection, etc.)
- Persistent login/session management
- Role-based access control (if relevant)
- Third-party auth providers (if needed)

## Deliverables
- Written analysis of available options and recommended approach
- List of required changes to front-end and back-end
- (Optional) Wireframes or UI mockups for the login flow

## Next Steps
- Assign this task to a developer or architect
- Schedule review with stakeholders after analysis
