# Bug: Relationship and Enum Selects Not Rendering in Admin Forms

**Status:** Completed
**Completion Date:** 2025-04-24
**Priority:** High

## Summary
After recent type and build fixes, the admin form UI no longer displays select inputs for:
- Enum fields (enumerations)
- Relationship fields (using the `StrapiRelationField` component)

No select dropdowns appear for these field types, preventing users from selecting values for these fields.

---

## Analysis
- **Root Cause:**
  - The regression likely happened during the recent TypeScript type safety and build fix refactor. In particular:
    - Prop changes and stricter typing in `DynamicStrapiForm.tsx`, `useFormFactory.tsx`, and `strapiToFormConfig.ts` may have broken the logic that maps Strapi enum and relation fields to the correct form components.
    - The `StrapiRelationField` component may not be rendered at all, or its props may not be passed correctly.
    - Enum fields may not be mapped to a select input, or the options array may be missing or incorrectly typed.
- **Symptoms:**
  - Enum fields are rendered as plain inputs or not rendered at all.
  - Relationship fields do not show a dropdown or multi-select, or the dropdown is empty.
- **Relevant Files to Review:**
  - `src/utils/strapiToFormConfig.ts` (field mapping logic)
  - `src/components/dynamic-form/DynamicStrapiForm.tsx` (dynamic field rendering)
  - `src/hooks/useFormFactory.tsx` (form factory logic)
  - `src/components/admin/StrapiRelationField.tsx` (relation select component)

---

## Proposed Solution
1. **Review and Restore Field Mapping:**
   - Ensure that in `strapiToFormConfig.ts`, enum fields are mapped to a select component with a valid `options` array.
   - Ensure that relation fields are mapped to use the `StrapiRelationField` component, with all required props.
2. **Check Dynamic Rendering:**
   - In `DynamicStrapiForm.tsx` and `useFormFactory.tsx`, verify that fields with `type: 'enum'` or `type: 'relation'` are rendered as select inputs or with `StrapiRelationField`, respectively.
3. **Component Integration:**
   - Make sure the `StrapiRelationField` component is being rendered and receives the correct props (`target`, `isMulti`, `displayField`, etc.).
   - For enums, ensure the select receives the correct `options` prop.
4. **Testing:**
   - Test the admin UI for collections with enum and relation fields.
   - Verify that selects appear and function correctly for both single and multi-value relations and enums.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to any collection in the admin interface with enum or relation fields.
2. Try to create or edit a record.
3. Observe that select dropdowns for enum and relationship fields are missing.

## Expected Behavior
- Enum fields should show a select dropdown with all possible values.
- Relationship fields should show the appropriate select/multi-select (via `StrapiRelationField`) with options fetched from the related collection.

## Actual Behavior
- No select inputs are rendered for these fields; users cannot select enum or relation values.
