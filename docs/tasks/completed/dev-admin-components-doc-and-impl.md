# Task: Admin Components Doc and Implementation

- **Title:** Admin Components Doc and Implementation
- **Date created:** (see pending doc)
- **Author:** (see pending doc)
- **Description:**
  - Implemented and fixed admin panel components for correct tag selector logic, relation/media normalization, and Strapi integration.
  - Refactored tag selector to fetch tags lazily and filter by correct appliesTo/plural.
  - Ensured all Strapi update payloads for tags/media send only the required fields (no extra id, created_at, etc.).
  - Updated table queries to always populate relations.
  - Refactored image handling to use Next.js <Image /> for optimal performance.
  - Cleaned up unused imports and resolved all ESLint/type errors.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Tag selector fetches and filters tags correctly and lazily.
  - Admin table queries populate all relations.
  - Tag/media update payloads are minimal and conform to Strapi requirements.
  - No ESLint/type errors or build failures.
  - All code is organized, documented, and maintainable.
- **Completion date:** 2025-04-26
- **Resolution summary:**
  - All requirements implemented and verified. Build passes cleanly. UI and backend integration confirmed working. See commit for details.
