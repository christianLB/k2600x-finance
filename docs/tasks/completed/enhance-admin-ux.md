# Completed: Enhance Admin UX Experience

**Completion Date:** 2025-04-24

## Summary

The admin interface has been enhanced with the following deliverables:

- **Persistent Sidebar:** A left sidebar lists all user-relevant collections (excluding internal/system collections) for easy navigation.
- **Modal Forms:** All create/edit forms now open in modal dialogs, improving usability and keeping users in context.
- **UI/UX Improvements:** General design, accessibility, and responsiveness improvements were applied to the admin area.
- **View Persistence:** Explicitly excluded from this iteration as per requirements.

## Key Files
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/Sidebar.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`

## Testing
- Sidebar navigation and modal forms should be tested for usability and accessibility.
- Further feedback and iterations can be addressed in future tickets.
